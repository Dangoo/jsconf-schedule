# JSConf and CSSConf schedule

Hey there! [JSConfEU](http://jsconf.eu) is a great conference but sadly(!) the schedule is all wrapped up in a [Google Spreadsheet](http://2017.jsconf.eu/rough-schedule/).

This is an offline capable web application that has the full schedule for CSSConfEU and JSConfEU.

You can visit the app at [https://jsconf.philna.sh](https://jsconf.philna.sh).
