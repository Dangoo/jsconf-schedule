          "description": "This talk is about hierarchies: as CSS hurtles toward being object- and systems-oriented, the titles and responsibilities of designer and developer become much more fluid and yet, we continue to categorise. We draw lines between front and back end, between CSS and Javascript (‚ÄúCSS isn‚Äôt _real_ development‚Äù), and even between CSS disciplines, but why? Furthermore, we implicitly draw these lines between white male developers and everyone else. This results in damaging hierarchies that threaten to devalue the work we do in diversifying CSS ‚Äî both as a language and as a community."

          "description": "To render a webpage browsers needs to go through the complex dance of networking, parsing and painting before any content can be displayed to your user. Over the years, we've developed mechanisms and hacks to aid the browser at each stage of this process, but these have always come at some cost or trade-off. How can we utilize modern web platform features to load our CSS as fast as possible? Should we still be inlining our critical content into the document or instead, how can HTTP/2 server push and Service Workers help us? In this talk we will take a journey exploring the current, past, and future best-practices for loading CSS in the browser and how we can achieve a first meaningful paint within1000ms. Ultimately creating a faster, more resilient experience for our users."

Do you want to re-use component styles, but have some styles overwrite others due to that cascade? Not sure where to start with CSS architecture? In this talk, you'll learn how to get started with your own lightweight, localised CSS setup. We'll go through how we use Grandstand, a CSS framework built by BBC Sport, as the scaffolding for our CSS. Starting with bare bones of just ~10kb, it has the flexibility to allow layouts in10 scripts for20+ languages, and we‚Äôre using it across the BBC News & Sport sites."

It gives you a way of understanding why things are weird, which is a good starting point to avoiding or fixing weirdness. It can give you an early heads up as to what might be happening in the very near future. It also opens up an opportunity to be part of the process, to contribute to CSS - just like any open source project. Then once we have new CSS on the horizon, we can all be part of encouraging browser vendors to ship it!"

They wanted to explore their creativity, to experiment with the tools that are out there, to learn from each other, and to have fun. In this talk, Shirley and Nadieh will share the lessons they learned while working on data sketches. They will highlight their favorite months of data, sketches, and code: what made them their favorites, the mistakes made along the way, and how they overcame them. They hope that by sharing their visualizations‚Äô humble, ugly duckling beginnings and their many (embarrassing) iterations, that it will inspire others to create their own unique and compelling visualizations.

In this talk, we‚Äôll take an empathetic look at these new approaches, how they relate to the history of CSS, and why they might possibly hold the key to the future of CSS‚Äîall from the point-of-view of someone who has been writing CSS since 1999."

          "description": "Building user interfaces on the web is hard, because the web, and thus CSS, was inherently made for documents. Because UIs fundamentally are not documents, we've seen a mindset shift towards building component-based system. The rise of JavaScript frameworks like React, Ember and recently Angular2, the effort of the W3C to standardize a web-native component system, pattern libraries and styleguides being considered 'the right way to build web applications' and many other things have illuminated this revolution ‚Äì we are now in the \"Component Age\". With that and a few more things in mind, Max along with Glen Maddern (co-creator of css-modules) sat down and started thinking about styling in this new era. They took the best of CSS and the Web to build a new way to style component-based systems. In this talk, Max will describe what they thought about and why they arrived where they did ‚Äì <üíÖ> styled-components."

What would code from1995 look like rewritten with today‚Äôs JavaScript? In this talk I will answer those questions by implementing TodoMVC in some early browsers.

          "description": "Functional programming has been gaining a lot of popularity in the JS community, and with good reason: rejecting side-effects and mutability - in-place changes to data - helps avoid a lot of headaches. But when you refuse to mutate objects, you have to create a whole new object each time something changes, which can slow things down and eat up memory, making functional programming seem inefficient. That‚Äôs where immutable data structures come in - to save the day, and time and space! Also called ‚Äúpersistent data structures‚Äù, they help you efficiently make new ‚Äúmodified‚Äù versions of immutable objects, by reusing parts of the old object that you don‚Äôt need to change. In this talk we‚Äôll take a look at how these data structures work, why they‚Äôre fantastic for functional programming, and how we can easily use them in our JS code thanks to libraries like Mori and Immutable.js."

          "description": "Did you know that how we learn JavaScript has changed a huge amount over the last ten years? Lots of small changes in how we introduce people to JS have built up over time into a radical difference - these changes are based in sociolinguistics! Our community‚Äôs communication has evolved rapidly. We‚Äôve moved from only valuing the opinions of senior developers to recognising the importance of contributions from people at all stages of learning. Learning itself has become a form of participating. These are examples of the sociolinguistic concepts of legitimation and positive welcoming. My talk will introduce the basics of sociolinguistics, how we are already using them, and how we can integrate them more effectively to start building a more inclusive and welcoming space for everyone in the JS community."

Or an image into pixels, which you can then style with CSS? What if it was easy to build these tools, embed them on any sites, and give them out to people, so that they can make art?

Unsatisfied with traditional computer science textbook and what we felt like not so learner friendly software engineering landscape, we decided to learn by working together in the format we enjoy the most - creative project. We are building machines (both software and hardware) in JavaScript to send secret messages to each other. Different forms of data blob are exchanged periodically as a message. In order to read those messages, each has to learn and build a system to decode the data. This talk will tell the story of the machines, their parts, and the possibilities of remote creative collaboration.

Through interviews and a survey, we found that developers within a community or platform often share cohesive practices (e.g., semver, backporting, synchronized releases), but that those practices differ from community to community, and that most developers are not aware of alternative strategies and practices, their tradeoffs, and why other communities adopt them. Most interestingly, it seems that often practices and community consensus seems to be driven by implicit values in each community, such as stability, rapid access, or ease to contribute. Understanding and discussing values openly can help to understand and resolve conflicts, such as discussions between demands for more stability and a pursuit of frequent and disruptive innovations."

          "description": "Of course you know what beautiful code looks like. Too bad nobody actually agrees with you. So, what exactly makes beautiful code? Is it readability? Elegance? Simplicity? How much of it depends on the programming language, on your coding style and on the actual code you‚Äôre writing? The presentation will contain nothing but code and thus the talk will be largely non-technical."

Creating a calendar that works correctly all across the world for42 different languages and even more locales, is not something that you do in a week. In this talk I will talk to you about the weird things I learned. From Brazilian Summer Time and Slovakian date formatting, to surprises in open-sources libraries and dealing with wrong assumptions. And how to avoid the many (many!) mistakes I made."

I will show you, how to craft complex applications using shared memory and gain massive performance boost by utilizing all available CPU cores for parallel computation on same data. I will also teach you how to write safe code while using shared memory and avoiding deadlocks of web workers. I will introduce a custom TypeScript like language called TurboScript for easy parallel programming which will generate efficient asm.js like JavaScript. Finally I will do a live demo of an app created using shared memory and TurboScript ‚ÄúA Global Illumination Ray Tracing Renderer for Three.js‚Äù"

This is a disaster about a typo. This is a thriller about technology out of control. This is a tragedy about wasted CPU cycles. This is a cautionary tale about living in the age of ServiceWorker."

          "description": "JavaScript Style Sheets (JSSS) was a technology introduced by Netscape in 1996. Chances are, you‚Äôve never heard of JSSS, since it was available in Netscape Communicator4.0. They allowed you to define custom styling rules for your web pages. You‚Äôre probably more familiar with its competitor at the time‚ÄîCSS. They were pretty cool though. JSSS allowed the developer to style the DOM using a full programming language with variables, conditionals, and functions. The obvious spoiler alert here is that CSS won and JSSS lost, right? It‚Äôs not that simple. A lot of the ideas from JSSS have slowly been creeping back into our toolset. SASS brought programming logic back into styling our applications. CSS picked up variables and the ability to do calculations. Finally, the React community has been‚Äîmaybe unknowingly‚Äîbringing JSSS back from the dead. In this talk, we‚Äôll take a good hard look at JSSS and the ways in which JSSS has had enduring legacy after its untimely demise."
