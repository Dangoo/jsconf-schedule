          <p><time>11:15</time> Back Track</p>
          <div class="description">
            <p>In June, we published the Extensible Web Manifesto, declaring that the web platform should be built a series of extensible layers. Low-level capabilities, like hardware access, cryptography, or the parser, should be exposed to web developers through JavaScript, and higher-level features, like HTML tags or animations, should be explained in terms of those primitives. This allows JavaScript developers to extend the web platform without rewriting it from scratch in JavaScript, customizing it for the needs of their applications and creating a virtuous cycle wherein web developers prototype higher-level features that implementers can later pull in.</p>

            <p>In this talk, I want to explore the concrete meaning of the extensible web. What initiatives already under way can we see through this lens? What ideas are still gestating, and need your input as a web developer? How will this new philosophy end up impacting you? I want to show you the future of the web platform, where developers like you are involved from the beginning in designing and prototyping APIs, and have enough low-level tools at your fingertips to solve any problem you face. And I want to bring it all back to our favorite language, JavaScript, which is the glue that makes this all work together.</p>

            <p>When using pattern based music composition software, especially the old genre of the Tracker I grew up with, the composition process is quite comparable to coding. So why not pushing this analogy to the max and actually program the music in JavaScript? In a browser? Live? That's exactly what I'm planning to do in this talk, using a little web app I wrote. I'll also talk briefly about other livecoding environments, how my (simple) approach works and if all goes well, by the end of the session, you'll all be shakin' yer asses to the beat.</p>

            <p>There are lot of tools (CoffeeScript, Typescript, Dart, JSLint / JSHint etc..) that we can use to help us write better JavaScript and many frameworks (Backbone, Ember, Angular etc..) that can help us structure large applications. But…</p>

            <p>What if you already have a large code base and are not able to re-write your whole application in a new way?</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>The audio sprites idea is similar to images sprites &ndash; it is a way to combine different files into one to get a lot of advantages like a solution for mobiles and other limited browsers, less requests and even smaller files.</p>

            <p>All this sounds like the ‘Holy Grail' of &lt;audio&gt; feature and an awesome solution to implement in any browser game or app. But is it really perfect in every case?</p>

            <p>The Grepolis team always wants to deliver the best user experience as possible to every user &ndash; even to browsers with their limitations. Therefore we decided to implement audio sprites in our game. In the meantime we made tests and measurements of CPU and memory usage which demonstrated a meaningful use of them &ndash; and I wanted to show it to you.</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>JavaScript is misunderstood. It looks like C, acts like Lisp, but deviates in important and confusing ways. It can mimic classical behavior but is built on prototypes. It has blocks but doesn't provide block scope. Then, throw in the magical "this" keyword and we have a recipe for interpreted disaster. Understanding how JavaScript creates and executes function objects is key to understanding JavaScript. In this talk we'll walk through the JavaScript interpreter in an easy-to-follow no-confusing-jargon manner. You'll leave with a better understanding of vanilla JavaScript!</p>

Let's blow the covers off of what's going on when the browser renders your web page. Rather than do this by explaining all the complicated technology involved, your humble hosts from the Chrome rendering team will just take a few website and show you what it looks like when we do performance profiling.

Bootstrapped start-ups don't always have the budget for a dedicated Uxer to help you design the best apps, software or websites. So how do design great things without a Uxer? This is not a definitive guide or to even to be used instead of getting professional UX help but it will get you started developing the right way and stop you making classic mistakes.Before you even consider touching your dev environment I will show you how to "Start with one idea", "Think like a user" and set out your user journeys. From this solid foundation I will show you how to wireframe your logic and build it as rough a prototype as you can manage. We then consider how to evaluate and iterate on your designs and what tools you can use. Finally, I outline the importance of never being afraid to scrap anything which doesn't work. All without a single line of code being written.</p>

            <p>It's funny the way dog owners look like their pets, but how much do we resemble our language? In my art project, poetry.js, I use the execution and semantics of JavaScript to explore different aspects of humanity, and from those explorations, I hope to show you that underneath, despite our share of bad parts, there's a very elegant core to people. We have insecurities and overconfidence - common problems to avoid - but I'll discuss strategies for resolving them. All this through a series of executing poems. You'll hoist. You'll loop forever.

Today, a similar shift is happening - stories are becoming non-linear, rich in media and crossing over into the real world. From transmedia theatre to games and interactive narratives, the way we tell stories is changing, and JavaScript is emerging as an essential tool for storytellers.</p>

            <p>I will talk about how JavaScript is increasing the possibilities of interactive storytelling and media art experiences, such as enabling the manipulation of sound with libraries such as Buzz, and delivering transmedia narrative through mobile devices using PhoneGap and HTML5.

            <p>JavaScript was developed as a simple language for adding dynamic effects to one-paged sites. With the emerging complexity of contemporary web applications, non-strictness of JavaScript becomes problematic. The Web development community has created a number of technologies to statically check the correctness of JavaScript code, however, there's a limit to what those tools can infer from the code, and their efficiency can be greatly improved by adding type annotations to your code, either through JSDoc or by using a language that compiles to JavaScript and supports optional typing.</p>

            <p>In my presentation I'll give some examples showing which errors can be prevented using these tools. Also I'll show how a modern JavaScript IDE can improve your coding experience when it has some information about types.</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>While module systems like AMD and CommonJS have become common place for Javascript, CSS has been lagging behind.</p>

            <p>Why modular CSS? In large scale apps managing CSS dependencies is cumbersome. Lack of granular CSS deps leads to pulling in unnecessary CSS on page render causing bloat. When refactoring code, the CSS order can change disfiguring the rendered page. Also, since it's hard to know which CSS effects which parts of the page, all of the CSS is bundled together and downloaded at initialization, so the initial page load time is slowed down.</p>

            <p>This talk describes the CSS dependency system in Google+. It improves end user latency by initially loading only a small set of CSS, and late loading CSS modules, as needed. It improves maintainability, making refactoring easier. Finally, the dependency system enables packaging HTML, CSS and Javascript together into distinct UI elements for reusability, and fewer wiring points boost developer productivity.</p>

            <p>Technology is often seen as somehow objective, especially by people who don't know much about how it's made.</p>

            <p>But like everything that involves human decision-making, it's riddled with biases.</p>

            <p>In search of profit (or sometimes innocent simplification) we have the choice to for example reduce human friendship, with all their nuances, to a boolean: friendship is approved or it isn't.</p>

            <p>I want to tell stories which will make it clear how we shape technologies with our belief and value systems.</p>

            <p>Among them, a story of a London university which built a computer system to deal with the first round of admission, presumed to be objective and based on logic. It was later discovered to inherit all biases of the people who were doing its job in previous academic years, because that's what the system was based on.</p>

            <p>Or another story, of the biggest encyclopaedia ever created, one that removes barriers to entry and truly democratises knowledge. Only it doesn't quite achieve that despite the ambition, as the participants are largely a self-selected group that lacks involvement of huge swaths of society.</p>

            <p>How we look at these biases will be crucial in building a better world, one where we acknowledge and address the issues we build into technology in the first place. The decisions we make in designing the tools of tomorrow are necessarily political and I want to leave you examining your own.</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>We spend our days creating large-scale applications byte by byte. But what happens at night when we get rid of bloated libraries and browser dependencies? What will we discover deep under the surface if we dissect the language of the web into its atomic parts?</p>

            <p>In this talk we will hack tweet-sized games, write code in only six characters and create the self-modifying "Hello World" in less than 1024 bytes of JavaScript. All just for fun and without asking "Why?".</p>

            <p>Prepare yourself for 140 slides full of old-school ASCII art and crazy code golfing!</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>In 1993 we build successful applications like email servers and clients - successful because they were build on open protocols. In 2003 we built great web servers - successful for being distributed and runnable by anyone. In 2013 we build applications against APIs that came usage limits and that would shut you down if you were in the wrong "quadrant". Where did we go so wrong?</p>
