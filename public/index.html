            <p>Recursion, instantiate, lexical scope - where do these words come from?! If you've ever been in conversation with other developers and thought, "I think I know what they're talking about, but I'm not sure&hellip;", you're not alone. Let's delve into the weird and wonderful parlance that computer scientists and developers have created for themselves. Whether the words are borrowed or just plain made up, I'll uncover how they made their way into the vocabulary of the modern programmer.</p>

            <p>In this session, you'll learn everything from etymology to history to broader definitions, all of which can help you understand what the heck that person's rambling about. So, the next time you're in conversation, you'll be the one discussing dependency injection versus inversion of control with ease.</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>We all take for granted that when we push enter in the browsers address bar, magic happens. The browser gets our HTML, that intern requests all the dependencies, insert magic, other things happen and then we have our site rendered. Simple, right, right&hellip;</p>

            <p>Like many people as I've progressed in my career, building for the web, I've become curious as to how the browser does what it does. What makes it tick, how it turns a string of HTML into a data structure, how CSS &amp; JavaScript come into play. Things like render tree, style recalculation, paints, reflows, all alien words will start to make sense by the end of this talk.</p>

            <p>Suddenly you'll understand why people recommend you place script tags at the bottom of the document, inlining critical CSS &amp; all sorts of other performance techniques.</p>

            <p>This is the story of a new browser with a complicated legacy. It&rsquo;s a story about making new friends without alienating old acquaintances. Most of all, it&rsquo;s a story about innovating without breaking the Web. This is the story of Microsoft Edge, the new browser in Windows 10, how it came to be, what separates it from Internet Explorer and what that means for web developers. It&rsquo;s a tale of epic proportions with a happy ending that is really only the beginning.</p>

            <p>If extensive libraries and even the tiniest module followed SemVer strictly, dependency hell would be a thing of the past … but humans weren&rsquo;t made to follow rules.</p>

            <p>There are way more than 150.000 packages on npm today – the most of any registry. Using the right packages in your own modules and applications makes JavaScript the joy to develop it is today. But if even immensely popular libraries fail to properly declare breaking changes, how can we trust the over 50.000 strangers who developed all these modules? Currently we can&rsquo;t. Let me show you how to write confidence-inspiring modules with breaking change detection and fully automated, tested releases including changelogs. Machines do a way better job with this than buggy humans.</p>

Developers, as magicians, can use the same techniques to distort users&rsquo; perception of time to deliver fast and competitive products. The talk is about psychology, perception, time and, of course, illusions.</p>

            <p>Web-based WYSIWYG editors are notorious for spitting out a distasteful HTML soup. In this talk I&rsquo;ll show how I implemented an editor that, instead of trying to filter and clean this soup, takes control away from the browser&rsquo;s contentEditable implementation, and reinterpret user actions as operations on our own semantic document model (i.e. not HTML). The result is a WYSIWYM (what you see is what you mean) editor, more predictable than classic WYSIWYG, and just as user friendly.</p>

            <p>Modern web developers have become heavily dependent on abstractions like jade, sass or ES6. These are powerful tools, but to themselves require new abstractions, wrappers and runners. The rate at which new tools, workflows and even languages are appearing is staggering. Each iteration adds more complexity and less interoperability.</p>

Because of this we chose to explore Web Components in the last year and I want to share what we have learned. I will go over the current state and support of all Web Components building blocks. It will get technical fast as I tell you why polyfills did not work for us. We continued to investigate the underlying technology and wrote our own library that I want to share with you.

             <p>Are you interested in learning about functional programming? Are you reaching the limits of abstraction when programming in JavaScript? Do you sometimes find yourself lost in a forest of callbacks? In this talk we explore functional programming concepts, which help us create powerful abstractions to master complex problems and create more simple and elegant programs.</p>

            <p>JavaScript allows us to ease into the functional programming style, letting us focus just on the concepts, without the distraction of learning a specific functional programming language.</p>

            <p>To make the dry functional programming concepts more digestible, we use cooking as an analogy. And since the logician Haskell Curry invented functional programming, we combine our journey in JavaScript with examples and recipes for tasty curry dishes. So even if you get stuck on concepts like higher order functions, continuation passing style or monads, you will at least not go home hungry.</p>

            <p>User input and string manipulation are central to development, but many engineers and even popular libraries struggle with Unicode.

Security and the need for internationalization both throw these issues into stark relief. This talk highlights the many problems related to Unicode in JavaScript regular expressions, demonstrates how ES6 (aka. ECMAScript 2015) helps solve these issues, and explains how to polyfill in the mean time.</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>Every time we solve an everyday programming problem we learn from its solution. When we come across a similar problem later on, we think &ldquo;aha! I&rsquo;ve seen this before! I know how to solve it!&rdquo;. Many of us are also familiar with design patterns, which aim to solve entire classes of problems.</p>

            <p>There also exists, however, a different kind of pattern. But, as opposed to help you structure a whole compiler or application, these patterns love hiding in small things like methods or functions, or even binary operations. They whisper to you when you concatenate two strings or map over a list.</p>

            <p>These abstractions have superpowers, too. They can separate the what from the when, or from the how. They can add together things other than numbers. They can control time. In this talk you will discover the amazing power of small abstractions. After, you&rsquo;ll start hearing their whispers and seeing their breadcrumb trails. Only then you will be ready to let them unfold their full potential in your programs.</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>In the recent time Web development community had a big discussion on &ldquo;DOM is slow&rdquo; topic. This thesis is truthful. DOM is a quite complex model which starts a ripple of events or chain reaction over document on every modification. HTML GL solves &ldquo;the slow DOM problem&rdquo; by creating WebGL representations of DOM elements and hiding actual DOM after. This speeds up HTML/CSS animations and transformations by using 3D hardware acceleration and allows to apply OpenGL effects as modern 3D games have.</p>

            <p>2015 is when WebRTC broke through. Barely a standard it already has its own conferences, yet is mostly known for it&rsquo;s ability to do video calling. It is time the web developer community becomes aware of all the powers of WebRTC and a browser-to-browser web that can be faster, more resilient and safer. This talk wants to open minds, through the power of code and demos, showing incredibly useful, fun and even ridiculous use-cases (from WebTorrent to Karaoke to Selfies) cut through the complexity of WebRTC and inspire what could become the democratisation of the web.</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>We present a functional take on front-end data-binding. MVC, MVP, MVVM, just the V – there are many useful architectures for data binding when data changes in discrete chunks. For data that changes continuously in time (animations, gesture controlled UI, responsive layout, etc), these are not the best tools. By treating continuously changing layout data in a functional way, and updating discrete changes to a model&rsquo;s data in an MV* way, we can split the data-binding problem into two cleanly separated problems. In so doing we make all our tools better at what they do best.</p>

            <p>Michael&rsquo;s talk, It&rsquo;s All Just Functions And Variables, will tell the story of how weeks of being taunted by nonsensical compiler errors and a supportive community turned him, a "lowly" front end developer, into a core contributor to LibSass - a large C/C++ project. He will unravel the stigma that "front end developers aren't real programmers" which propagates throughout the industry and into the hearts and minds of fellow developers.</p>

            <p>Michael will convince you that regardless of whether you write CSS, JavaScript or COBOL, you are as much a programmer as anyone on your team or the intenet, and that it&rsquo;s not our languages that define us but our willingness to learn to master our domain.</p>

It&rsquo;s all possible (mostly).</p>

            <p>This talk is about a new format for CSS, one that&rsquo;s now supported by default in Webpack &amp; JSPM, and available with plugins for Browserify. It&rsquo;s called Interoperable CSS, and it hopes to do for CSS what CommonJS did for JavaScript.</p>

All with far less CSS.</p>

            <p>In this talk, you&rsquo;ll learn what flexbox features are particularly suited to responsive layouts and how you can harness them by applying flexbox as a progressive enhancement.

            <p>Modern JavaScript libraries and frameworks have become the de facto standard in web application development. However, the great strides in innovation have created framework-specific security vulnerabilities that most modern JavaScript security scanners are not programmed to search for. Personal research with intentionally vulnerable applications as well as live production code has shown that many popular scanners do not detect common application vulnerabilities.</p>

            <p>This talk will discuss some common security pitfalls developers make when working with popular client-side JavaScript frameworks. Intentionally vulnerable applications developed with Backbone.js, Angular.js, Ember.js, and Meteor,js will be attacked and exploited live. Github links to the vulnerable applications used in this presentation will be released after the presentation. Through strengthening the security posture of JavaScript applications, we can take strides towards creating a more secure Internet.</p>

            <p>JavaScript that writes JavaScript: Christoph will give an intro to jscodeshift and the underlying tools like recast and ast-types that help rewrite and modernize a lot of Facebook&rsquo;s JavaScript code day-to-day. We&rsquo;ll explore why these tools become increasingly important and how they change how we think about open source and breaking API changes at Facebook. At the end of the talk everyone will be able to run their own code transformations across all of their projects safely and efficiently.</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>In the recent years high-level frameworks have become the de facto standard for writing client-side webapp code. Angular, Polymer, or Dart all provide extremely useful abstractions for building applications, but also indirectly expose rough edges of the web platform which often lead to vulnerabilities (e.g. XSS).</p>

            <p>In my talk I will provide a security engineer&rsquo;s perspective on some of the common pitfalls which tend to affect code written using such frameworks based on real examples of bugs in Google apps. I will also explain why security reviews of such apps are often more difficult to conduct than those of &ldquo;bare metal&rdquo; JS code, what could be done to fix this, and why framework designers should care about it.</p>

            <p>After a local VanJS meetup, my friends and I were tossing around project ideas. Someone referenced a website that would procedurally generate terrible ideas for video games. &ldquo;A tycoon game where you draw horses indefinitely&rdquo;.</p>

            <p>What a wonderful, terrible, awful idea for a game.</p>

            <p>In this presentation, we go through the 1000 lines of Javascript and two weeks of drunken after-work coding required to produce the world&rsquo;s only horse drawing tycoon simulator, with Canvas, Twitter integration, the legendary HorseHash™ algorithm, HorseCurrency™, and HorseStamps®!</p>

            <p>On 23rd July 2014, the first case of Ebola was reported in Nigeria, home to a small NGO working at the intersection of tech and public health. By then over 1000 cases had been reported in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. This is a story of how we use JavaScript to fight the Ebola outbreak. It&rsquo;s also a story of building good tech for hard places, where a stable internet connection is rare and emergencies are real. There are a lot of awesome technologies (e.g. CouchDB and PouchDB) out there to help you build offline applications. There is also no shortage of beginner level online tutorials to show you how to do a quick and nice first prototype, but as in any new field there is not so much documentation available to help you solve the problems you&rsquo;ll find when deploying your offline applications to be used in the &ldquo;real&rdquo; world. This talk will present some of these problems as well as the solutions we came up with, including some open source tools developed by ourselves.</p>

            <p>There was a time when data connections like WiFi and Bluetooth didn&rsquo;t exist, yet people still managed to send information over long distances using clever encodings like Morse Code, sound waves and visual impulses.</p>

            <p>What can we learn from that?</p>

            <p>This talk looks at ways to use web platform capabilities, like the Web Audio API, Ambient Light Events and Touch Events, to revisit old data transmission techniques and apply them in new contexts. We&rsquo;ll use demos to explore ultrasonic networking between air-gapped devices, indoor positioning without GPS and sending data through touch.</p>

            <p>Finally, we&rsquo;ll look at the privacy implications these unconventional networking capabilities bring.</p>

            <p>Moving up the ladder from forklift driver and general labourer, to front end developer, with a stint in manual testing, was a big challenge. However it&rsquo;s exactly what I did, and I couldn&rsquo;t have done it without following a few core principles.</p>

            <p>Getting up the nerve to go to local usergroups, and conferences, and discovering a new found love of public speaking, was a huge leap from labouring. Similarly, I discovered contributing to open source wasn&rsquo;t that big a deal, and some things certain projects did made it really easy! Also, learning about things like source control was super integral to being where I am today.</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>Web app technical diagrams fall into the trap of over simplifying complexity. And so diagrams which are meant to represent 1,000s or even 10,000s of hours of the large scale multidisciplinary construction effort that is a web app project is reduced to sticks-and-clouds architecture drawings, coarse wire frames and/or detailed UI mockups or screenshots.</p>

            <p>What&rsquo;s missing from these representations? Usually a lot - like code volume, 3rd party dependencies, environments, delivery processes and so much more. This talk presents a new vision of web app technology diagrams using the structural engineering drawing technique of isometric projections to provide much better perspective of the multi dimensional nature of web app programming projects.</p>

            <p>A taste of this new style of diagraming of web apps can be seen, today, at the speaker&rsquo;s site stackynotes.com but diagrams with much more depth and breadth will be explored in the actual conference talk.</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>We have ethical responsibilities when coding. We&rsquo;re able to extract remarkably precise intuitions about an individual. But do we have a right to know what they didn&rsquo;t consent to share, even when they willingly shared the data that leads us there? A major retailer&rsquo;s data-driven marketing accidentally revealed to a teen&rsquo;s family that she was pregnant. Eek.</p>

            <p>What are our obligations to people who did not expect themselves to be so intimately known without sharing directly? How do we mitigate against unintended outcomes? For instance, an activity tracker carelessly revealed users&rsquo; sexual activity data to search engines. A social network&rsquo;s algorithm accidentally triggered painful memories for grieving families who&rsquo;d recently experienced death of their child and other loved ones.</p>

            <p>We design software for humans. Balancing human needs and business specs can be tough. It&rsquo;s crucial that we learn how to build in systematic empathy.</p>
