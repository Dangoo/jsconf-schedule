          <p><time>10:00</time></p>
          <div class="description">
            <p>This talk is about hierarchies: as CSS hurtles toward being object- and systems-oriented, the titles and responsibilities of designer and developer become much more fluid and yet, we continue to categorise. We draw lines between front and back end, between CSS and Javascript (&ldquo;CSS isn&rsquo;t _real_ development&rdquo;), and even between CSS disciplines, but why? Furthermore, we implicitly draw these lines between white male developers and everyone else. This results in damaging hierarchies that threaten to devalue the work we do in diversifying CSS â€” both as a language and as a community.</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>To render a webpage browsers needs to go through the complex dance of networking, parsing and painting before any content can be displayed to your user. Over the years, we've developed mechanisms and hacks to aid the browser at each stage of this process, but these have always come at some cost or trade-off.</p>

            <p>How can we utilize modern web platform features to load our CSS as fast as possible? Should we still be inlining our critical content into the document or instead, how can HTTP/2 server push and Service Workers help us? </p>

            <p>In this talk we will take a journey exploring the current, past, and future best-practices for loading CSS in the browser and how we can achieve a first meaningful paint within 1000ms. Ultimately creating a faster, more resilient experience for our users.</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>Ever thought about localising your site, but realised it led to a lot of messy duplication? Do you want to re-use component styles, but have some styles overwrite others due to that cascade? Not sure where to start with CSS architecture?</p>

            <p>In this talk, you'll learn how to get started with your own lightweight, localised CSS setup. We'll go through how we use Grandstand, a CSS framework built by BBC Sport, as the scaffolding for our CSS. Starting with bare bones of just ~10kb, it has the flexibility to allow layouts in 10 scripts for 20+ languages, and we&rsquo;re using it across the BBC News &amp; Sport sites.</p>

            <p>For centuries the visual arts have been used to tell stories, warn people about dangers and invoke emotion. Today we use the internet for all those purposes and more. Just as the Vatican employed painters to spread their message â€“ it will be the developers and designers who will lead us into the next Renaissance. But there is still a lot to learn from the great masters. In this talk, we will flexbox the Golden Ratio with Leonardo DaVinci, up the pixel ratio for our devices with the Impressionists &amp; &ldquo;inspect elements&rdquo; of some iconic works of art to make the web a more beautiful place.</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>As user interfaces evolve and become more interactive, design requirements become more complex. By combining CSS variables with reactive programming in JS, we can now express animations, styles, layout, and more in ways never before possible with CSS. In this talk, we&rsquo;ll explore what functional reactive programming is, why it is incredibly useful, and how we can leverage the power of CSS variables to push the limits of styling the web.</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p> Data sketches is a collaboration between Nadieh and Shirley, where they choose a topic and visualize it by the end of the month. The collaboration started for many reasons: they weren&rsquo;t creating as many personal data visualization projects, so they were looking for the motivation to make more. They wanted to explore their creativity, to experiment with the tools that are out there, to learn from each other, and to have fun.</p>

            <p>In this talk, Shirley and Nadieh will share the lessons they learned while working on data sketches. They will highlight their favorite months of data, sketches, and code: what made them their favorites, the mistakes made along the way, and how they overcame them. They hope that by sharing their visualizations&rsquo; humble, ugly duckling beginnings and their many (embarrassing) iterations, that it will inspire others to create their own unique and compelling visualizations. </p>

          <div class="description">
            <p> In the past few years, we&rsquo;ve witnessed a massive increase in the amount of CSS experimentation, with ideas like CSS Modules andâ€”most controversiallyâ€”the rise of CSS-in-JS. But does mixing our styles and logic run counter to the original ideas of CSS? Does it break progressive enhancement?</p>

            <p>In this talk, we&rsquo;ll take an empathetic look at these new approaches, how they relate to the history of CSS, and why they might possibly hold the key to the future of CSSâ€”all from the point-of-view of someone who has been writing CSS since 1999. </p>

          <p><time>15:30</time></p>
          <div class="description">
            <p>Building user interfaces on the web is hard, because the web, and thus CSS, was inherently made for documents. Because UIs fundamentally are not documents, we've seen a mindset shift towards building component-based system.</p>

            <p>The rise of JavaScript frameworks like React, Ember and recently Angular 2, the effort of the W3C to standardize a web-native component system, pattern libraries and styleguides being considered 'the right way to build web applications' and many other things have illuminated this revolution â€“ we are now in the "Component Age".</p>

            <p>With that and a few more things in mind, Max along with Glen Maddern (co-creator of css-modules) sat down and started thinking about styling in this new era. They took the best of CSS and the Web to build a new way to style component-based systems. In this talk, Max will describe what they thought about and why they arrived where they did â€“ <ðŸ’…> styled-components. </p>

            <p>Understanding how CSS is developed is more than an academic exercise. It gives you a way of understanding why things are weird, which is a good starting point to avoiding or fixing weirdness. It can give you an early heads up as to what might be happening in the very near future. It also opens up an opportunity to be part of the process, to contribute to CSS - just like any open source project. Then once we have new CSS on the horizon, we can all be part of encouraging browser vendors to ship it!</p>

            <p>Michael&rsquo;s talk, It&rsquo;s All Just Functions And Variables, will tell the story of how weeks of being taunted by nonsensical compiler errors and a supportive community turned him, a "lowly" front end developer, into a core contributor to LibSass - a large C/C++ project. He will unravel the stigma that "front end developers aren't real programmers" which propagates throughout the industry and into the hearts and minds of fellow developers.</p>

            <p>Michael will convince you that regardless of whether you write CSS, JavaScript or COBOL, you are as much a programmer as anyone on your team or the intenet, and that it&rsquo;s not our languages that define us but our willingness to learn to master our domain.</p>

            <p>Remember the old joke about how the Java slogan &ldquo;write once, run everywhere&rdquo; was more like &ldquo;write once, debug everywhere&rdquo;? Good one. Actually, many people say this about the Web, too. In fact, it would be more accurate in our case to state it as &ldquo;write once, debug everywhere, each time with different tools&rdquo;. But does it have to be that way?</p>

            <p>A new Firefox feature called Valence allows you to debug your web app in any target environment: Firefox, Chrome, iOS, Android, you name it. Does it actually work? How does it work? Can we expect more from it? How can other browsers use it? In this talk we will find the answers to these questions and discuss the accuracy of the tentative slogan &ldquo;write once, debug everywhere, from Firefox&rdquo; (or lack thereof).</p>

            <p>Modern JavaScript libraries and frameworks have become the de facto standard in web application development. However, the great strides in innovation have created framework-specific security vulnerabilities that most modern JavaScript security scanners are not programmed to search for. Personal research with intentionally vulnerable applications as well as live production code has shown that many popular scanners do not detect common application vulnerabilities.</p>

            <p>This talk will discuss some common security pitfalls developers make when working with popular client-side JavaScript frameworks. Intentionally vulnerable applications developed with Backbone.js, Angular.js, Ember.js, and Meteor,js will be attacked and exploited live. Github links to the vulnerable applications used in this presentation will be released after the presentation. Through strengthening the security posture of JavaScript applications, we can take strides towards creating a more secure Internet.</p>

It&rsquo;s also a story of building good tech for hard places, where a stable internet connection is rare and emergencies are real. There are a lot of awesome technologies (e.g. CouchDB and PouchDB) out there to help you build offline applications. There is also no shortage of beginner level online tutorials to show you how to do a quick and nice first prototype, but as in any new field there is not so much documentation available to help you solve the problems you&rsquo;ll find when deploying your offline applications to be used in the &ldquo;real&rdquo; world.

            <p>Web app technical diagrams fall into the trap of over simplifying complexity. And so diagrams which are meant to represent 1,000s or even 10,000s of hours of the large scale multidisciplinary construction effort that is a web app project is reduced to sticks-and-clouds architecture drawings, coarse wire frames and/or detailed UI mockups or screenshots.</p>

            <p>What&rsquo;s missing from these representations? Usually a lot - like code volume, 3rd party dependencies, environments, delivery processes and so much more. This talk presents a new vision of web app technology diagrams using the structural engineering drawing technique of isometric projections to provide much better perspective of the multi dimensional nature of web app programming projects.</p>
